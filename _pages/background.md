Education
======
I completed my graduation from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and later
earned my Post-Graduation in Big Data Analytics and Optimization from International
School of Engineering (INSOFE). This programme provided me with advanced abilities
in data analytics and machine learning, preparing me for real-world difficulties in the
rapidly changing sector of big data. My path at INSOFE was transformative, mirroring
my commitment to excellence in the field of data science. The programme provided me
with a thorough understanding of cutting-edge technology and processes, preparing me
to face real-world difficulties in the dynamic field of big data analytics.

**Technical Architecture Design**
============================
In addition to my role as a Data Scientist, I actively contribute to technical architecture
designs in projects, ensuring effective execution and fostering innovation. I understand
the importance of a robust technical foundation to support the deployment of scalable
solutions.
